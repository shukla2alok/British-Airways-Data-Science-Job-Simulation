# British Airways Job Simulation Program

## Overview

This project is part of the British Airways (BA) job simulation program, designed to address key challenges faced by BA in understanding customer feedback and improving overall customer experience. The project is divided into two main tasks, each addressing a critical aspect of the overall solution. This README provides an overview of the problem, how the project works, and the structure of the tasks.

## Problem Statement

British Airways, the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom, operates thousands of flights daily, carrying customers worldwide. Ensuring efficient operations and top-class customer service is a complex task with many responsibilities. Understanding customer feedback and improving service quality is crucial for BA to make informed business decisions, reduce costs, and increase revenue. This project aims to collect and analyze customer feedback from third-party sources to uncover insights that can drive key business decisions.

## Solution

Our project addresses this problem by implementing a two-task approach:

### Task 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights
1. **Objective:** 
   The goal of Task 1 is to scrape and analyze review data from the Skytrax website to gain valuable insights about airlines. This involves collecting a substantial amount of review data, cleaning and preparing it for analysis, and utilizing techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds to uncover key insights. The final step is to summarize these findings in a concise and visually appealing PowerPoint slide for presentation to the board.
2. **Methodology:** 
   - Scrape review data from the Skytrax website focusing on airline reviews.
   - Clean and prepare the text data for analysis.
   - Perform data analysis to uncover insights using techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, or word clouds.
   - Summarize findings in a PowerPoint slide with visualizations and key metrics.

### Task 2: Predictive Modeling for Customer Acquisition
1. **Objective:** 
   The goal of Task 2 is to manipulate and prepare customer booking data to build a high-quality predictive model that can forecast customers' likelihood of purchasing holidays. The task involves evaluating the model's performance and interpreting the results to understand the contribution of each variable to the model's predictive power.
2. **Methodology:** 
   - **Data Preparation:** 
     - Manipulate and prepare the provided customer booking data.
     - Ensure data quality by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
   - **Model Building:**
     - Train machine learning algorithms using the prepared data.
     - Experiment with different algorithms to determine the best-performing model.
   - **Model Evaluation:**
     - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
     - Analyze the model's results to interpret how predictive the data is.
     - Assess the contribution of each variable to the model's predictive power.
   - **Presentation:**
     - Summarize the model's findings and evaluation results.
     - Provide clear interpretations of the predictive model's outputs and variable contributions.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Scrape review data from the Skytrax website, focusing on reviews about British Airways.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and prepare the collected data for analysis, ensuring it is in a usable format.
3. **Data Analysis:** Perform analysis using techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds to uncover key insights.
4. **Model Building:** Prepare and manipulate customer booking data for predictive modeling.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict customer behavior.
6. **Presentation:** Summarize the findings from both tasks in a PowerPoint slide with visualizations and key metrics for easy understanding and presentation to the board.
